Web App Concept
Concept and Unique Features

The web app that I want to make is based around food delivery apps. It will have business and user accounts. The businesses will be able to upload their restaurants onto the platform and users will be able to view and order from them. The way this app will be unique from other food delivery apps and websites is that it will focus more on the businesses rather than the customers or users. For example, I would like to be able to add features such as sales statistics, a menu to add, edit or remove items, etc. Furthermore, I would like to advertise this web app towards smaller businesses or businesses that are just starting out. This would make these features more useful since they may not have their own menus, sales tactics or customer base already planned out or setup, so having software like this would probably be useful to them.

Alternatives and Inspiration

There are multiple food delivery apps out there such as Deliveroo and Uber Eats which are very consumer based however, I am unsure about the business side of these since I do not have my own restaurant.

Ideas and Approaches

I have decided that I will also have a customer side to the app as well. This will allow users to view all the added restaurants as well as their menus. This could be expanded further with useful information such as delivery times, locations, etc. Furthermore, I have also considered the idea of developing a feature that would allow users to donate or fund the small businesses that are present on the platform. With this feature, it would help to drive the focus on the small business aspect and provide a way for the app to become more than just a food delivery app.
Use of Data

My app will use an API to store data about the restaurants. For example, the name of the restaurant, the location, an image or logo. As well as this, there will be data for the menus such as images, names, descriptions and prices. Furthermore, some of the data will be for the users, such as their ID, their orders or baskets and their town or city so that the app wouldn’t show restaurants that are too far away.
Novel User Experience
The novelty of this app will be to show useful data to the user’s about their business as well as help to give them recommendations or ways that they could think about their business that they may not have thought of before. As well as this, the opportunity to gain funding through user donations would be a unique feature that not many apps have, especially in the food delivery space.
